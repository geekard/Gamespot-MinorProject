      <p>
        This page website was created as a project work by "Ayush Ranjan Dubey"
        from IIMS Meerut for his 5<sup>th</sup> sem minor project under the
        guidance of his teacher Mr.Piyush Agarwal from Midaslogix Infotech Pvt.
        Ltd. <br /><br />
        This project focuses on simple gaming aspects & provides games created
        by Ayush himself. The scope of this project can be said to be very large
        as while it currently holds only a few projects but it would only grow
        larger and larger as time passes and Ayush makes more and more projects.
